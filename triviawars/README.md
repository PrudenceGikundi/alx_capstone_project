           js to dynamically load questions and options from server

**Roadmap and future enhancements:**
In future I wish to use database as the mode of storage. It will be easier to track users progress using the same.
There will also be a multiple player option, different levels of difficulty as well as different topics to choose from.
in this case i will use API technology as well to fetch the questions
user will also be able to create a profile.
